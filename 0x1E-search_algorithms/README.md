| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Linear search](./0-linear.c) | function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm |
| [1. Binary search](./1-binary.c) | function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm  |
| [2. Big O #0](./2-O) | What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?  |
| [3. Big O #1](./3-O) | What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?  |
| [4. Big O #2](./4-O) | What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?  |
| [5. Big O #3](./5-O) | What is the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?  |
| [6. Big O #4](./6-O) | What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?  |

# 0x09. C - Static libraries
---
### 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the static library libholberton.a containing all the functions listed below:
* int _putchar(char c);
* int _islower(int c);
* int _isalpha(int c);
* int _abs(int n);
* int _isupper(int c);
* int _isdigit(int c);
* int _strlen(char *s);
* void _puts(char *s);
* char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
* int _atoi(char *s);
* char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
* char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
* char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
* int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
* char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
* char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
* char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
* unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
* char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
* char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
### 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
### 2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
Write a blog post on C static libraries. It should cover:

* Why use libraries
* How they work
* How to create them
* How to use them
Your posts should have examples and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on LinkedIn.

When done, please add all urls below (blog post, LinkedIn post, etc.)

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings
